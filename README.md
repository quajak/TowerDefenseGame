# TowerDefenseGame
A tower defense made game in C# using SFML. It has a few ideas not found in most other tower defense games.

Runs on https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/ but the dll should be included..

To start the game select a difficulty. In the game, first select the red main base and place it. Over time you gain money. To surivive you have to build towers. Good luck!
